# 11

* (a) How many nibbles are 16 bits?

$$16 \ 4 = 4$$

* (b) How many bytes are 32 bits?

$$32 / 8 = 4$$

* (c) If a word is defined as 16 bits, how many words is a 64-bit data item?

$$64 / 16 = 4$$

* (d) What is the exact value (in decimal) of 1 meg?

$$1 * 10^6 = 1,000,000$$

> without a suffix meg just means 1 million, but I'll also answer as if the question were what is the exact value of 1 megabyte.

$$2^{10^2} = 1,048,576$$

* (e) How many kilobytes is 1 meg?

This doesn't make sense. meg just means 1 million. If the question were how many kilobytes is 1 megabyte the answer would be 1024

* (f) What is the exact value (in decimal) of 1 gigabyte?

* (g) How many kilobytes is 1 gigabyte?

* (h) How many megs is 1 gigabyte?

* (i) If a given computer has a total of 8 megabytes of memory, how many bytes (in decimal) is this? How many kilobytes is this?
