> The normal distribtion is a bell-shaped curve defined by mean and standard deviation.

> The standard normal distribution is a special case where the mean is 0 and the deviation is 1. This is achieved by converting values into Z-scores. Meaning, the standard normal is a tranformation of any normal distrubtion into Z-scores.

> A normal distribution is a bell shape, with mean, modeian, and mode at the center. The total area under the curve is equal to 1. Most data will fall within 1 to 3 standard deviations of the mean.
