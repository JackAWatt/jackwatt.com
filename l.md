$26,26,29,30,32,33,45,60$

* mean

$\frac {26+26+29+30+32+33+45+60}{8} = 35.125$

* mean

$\frac{\sum x_i}{n}$


$\frac{\sum (0+2+5+8+9+11+12+14+22+33)}{11} = 11.18$

* squared deviations

$(0-11.18)^2 = 124.9924$

$(2-11.18)^2 = 84.2724$

$(5-11.18)^2 = 38.1924$

$(7-11.18)^2 = 17.4724$

$(8-11.18)^2 = 10.1124$

$(9-11.18)^2 = 4.7524$

$11-11.18)^2 = 0.0324$

$(12-11.18)^2 = 0.6724$

$(14-11.18)^2 = 7.9524$

$(22-11.18)^2 = 117.0724$

$(33-11.18)^2 = 476.1124$

$124.9924 + 84.2724 + 38.1924 + 17.4724 + 10.1124 + 4.7524 + 0.0324 + 0.6724 + 7.9524 + 7.9524 + 117.0724 + 476.1124 = 889.5888$

* divide by n - 1

$\frac {889.5888}{10} = 88.95888$

* take the square root

$\sigma = \sqrt{88.95888} = 9.4318015246$

* the standard deviation is 9.43

Chebyshev's theorem states that the proportion of values falling within k standard deviations of the mean is at least $1 - \frac {1}{k^2}$, for all $k>1$ 

This theorem is less precise than the normal distribution, but can be used for distributions when the shape isn't known.

$Z = \frac {40 - 30}{4.6} = 2.17$

$2.1 = 0.4821$

$2.2 = 0.4861$

$1-(.5+(.4821+.4861)/2) * 100= 15.9%$

* I checked a more preciseZ-score table, and for z=2.17, there is 15% probability that the water usage would be over 40 liters

# 5

Descriptive statistics' only analysis is in terms of central tendency(Mean, Mode, Median).

Inferential statistics goes beyond the available data to infer characteristics of the population and predict beyond the data.
