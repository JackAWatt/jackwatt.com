# device smart plant monitor

* Build a test circuit and write code to use a temperature sensor, humidity and moisture sensor, water level sensor, and ph sensor individually.
* Build a test circuit using a relay to run a water pump and lights
* Combine the circuits to pump water based on low moisture in soil and turn the lights on and off on a schedule
* Display the sensor values on an LCD
* Add the components to an enclosure for a plant
* Write a web server or use thingspeak to be able to monitor the sensors remotely
* Write code to be able to modify the program conditions remotely
* Design and print a PCB
* Design and create a case for the electronic components
* Graph sensor data over time to verify configuration is optimal. This will includes graphs and a table
