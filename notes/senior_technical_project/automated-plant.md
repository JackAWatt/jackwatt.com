# device smart plant monitor

* Build a test circuit and write code to use a temperature sensor, humidity and moisture sensor, water level sensor, and ph sensor individually.
* Build a test circuit using a relay to run a water pump and lights
* Combine the circuits to pump water based on low moisture in soil and turn the lights on and off on a schedule
* Write a web server or use thingspeak to be able to monitor the sensors remotely
* Write code to be able to modify the program conditions remotely
* Design and print a PCB
* Design and create a case for the electronic components
* Graph sensor data over time to verify configuration is optimal. This will includes graphs and a table

# -- old
* modify an enslosure to grow a plant and add a temperature sensor, Ph, humidity, and moisture sensor.
* Calibrate the sensors
* open and close a valve to be able to water the plant based on a moisture sensor
* turn on and off a grow light based on a programable 
* create a web server to be able to monitor and configure the device remotely
* create some sort of PCB or way to make the circuit permenant and possibly 3D print a case for the actual device(I say possibly because it could just be put in a project case)
* create a way to bring more than one of the devices online at once.

# use case

The use case for this product is to have a central device that monitors plants to determine Ph, humidity, moisture, and temperature. 

The plant could be put in a glass case with a water resovior and a heater and a fan, where: 

* if soil moisture is too low it will water the plant
* if the ph is too high or too low it will do something--I have no idea what to do in that case

There would be a website that would display the information for the system. Multiple of these devices could be created. My plan would be to create 2 of them, where the site would automatically add a new interface for each device added. 

There could also be a bluetooth connection to figure the devices to allow them onto a wifi network and to put in the credentials to connect to the web server, and for the ability to configure the device.

resovoir and pump to water the plant? suggestions?
