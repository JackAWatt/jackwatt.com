# N-device smart plant monitor

# use case

The use case for this product is to have a central device that monitors plants to determine Ph, humidity, moisture, and temperature. 

The plant could be put in a glass case with a water resovior and a heater and a fan, where: 

* if the temperature goes too low, the heater will come on
* if the moisture is too low it will water the plant on mist the leaves
* if the temperature is too high, it will turn the fan on
* if the ph is too high or too low it will do something--I have no idea what to do in that case

There would be a website that would display the information for the system. Multiple of these devices could be created. My plan would be to create 2 of them, where the site would automatically add a new interface for each device added. There could also be a bluetooth connection to figure the devices to allow them onto a wifi network and to put in the credentials to connect to the web server.
