Today, so far, I have been thinking about the size of an enclosure and which pant to buy. I believe I'm going to buy a orchid, as they are...


For power management I'm going to be using a 6v battery to power all of my project except the bits that need 12v(pump + lights)

I have tested my soil sensors, and wrote code to track the min and max value for the analog sensor. I have not yet worked out how to translate the analog value into an actual soil moisture level

I am ready to test my air based moisture level, as well as my water pump.

I'm also in the process of creating a a power circuit to provide the 3.3 volts to my esp-32, and 5v to any sensor that needs 5v.

I have a 12v battery for the water pump, although i think i can use the 6v battery I'm using to power the rest of my project, but I'll see as time goes on.

The current draw of my soil sensors is 5 mA
