I have a second esp32 now. I have it running the circuit for my water pump. Right now by changing a file on my website, I can start and stop my water pump. This is a temporary solution as a POC. Once I hit my first milestone, more time will be allocated to finding a permenant solution. Most likely a simple backend running something like MQTT. My site is run off of github pages, so I expect I would be rate limited if I were to consistently make web requests to my static site. 

How it is set up could work nicely for an initial configuration, or for something that's checked a few times per hour. I'm also going to want to do data logging, so I will need to figure something out.
