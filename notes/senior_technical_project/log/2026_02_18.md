I'm working on getting my LCD screen working again. It still doesn't work. I'm going to create test code for just the screen over the break.

I've also started to map out the layout for all of my components. I don't have a ciruit diagram yet because things are still changing, but my plan for the break is to finalize everything. Once I get my enclosure, everything should fall into place. I already have my esp32 and some components inside a container.

I'm working on code to communicate with a simple server. another goal over the break will be to set up something more permenant that allows for bidiectional communication. right now only my starting config can be read from a web server.
