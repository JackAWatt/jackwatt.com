Today I'm working on getting my sht31 humidity and temperature sensor set up with the rest of my components. It uses $I^2C$

`SDA` is on `GPIO pin 21`

`SCL` is on `GPIO pin 22`

its bus address is at `0x44`

So far I have wired:

* both soil moisture sensors
* the sht31 humidity and temperture sensor
* The water pump using an SSR

I have found out that the pH sensor I bought requires making a solution. It can't be placed directly into the soil, I bought the wrong device.
