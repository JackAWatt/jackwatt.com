# 9:11

I have tested my water pump. It draws 350 mA with the 12v battery and 180 with the 6v.

Now I'm working on testing my water level sensor.

# 10:35

The water level sensor works based on contact with the water. I'll have to find a way to attach the sensor to the side of my water container. I will have to cut a hole in the side of the container and then seal it back up using epoxy.

I had to build a voltage divider because the water level sensor outputs 5v, and my esp32 takes 3.3v. The values I used were 5k and 10k.

I made a mistake where I didn't connect my grounds and ended up with floating values.

Now I'm working on getting my esp-32 to send a signal to my SSR(solid state relay). I tried a voltage divider to take the 5v down to 3.3v, but with the 5k and 10k values, it wasn't enough current to energize the coil in the relay. 2k and 1k work. 


# 12:00

I ended the day by getting the water pump to run when the water level sensor detected water.


# for next week

I'll have to get a plant, an enclosure for the plant, and get all of my sensors together to meet my first milestone.

I have some work to do outside of class, which will require writing code and documentation.
