I'm having issues with my screen, which I've just hooked back up after tidying up my project. 

There is some back powering from one of my esp32 pins. I've spent some time doing continuity tests to see if there is anything connected that shouldn't be. So far I can't find anything. I'm using cheap female to female wires that are in blocks of 3, I'm going to test these to make sure there is no connection between them. I'm also going to look at my code to make sure i have all the pins connected, as well as removing my other sensors to see if they are the culprit.
