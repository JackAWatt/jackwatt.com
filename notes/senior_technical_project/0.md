# Mesh network on top of all devices

* Reseach devices that support both bluetooth and wifi
  * pick a device that supports both backbone and edge(most likely esp32)
  * pick a number of devices to start with(most likely 4, 2 being edge nodes and 2 being core nodes)
  * Research application layer bridges and pick protocols
    * CBOR/protobuf/json?
  * research encryption alogrithms to encrypt communications between devices.
  * research mesh network frameworks (ESP-MESH, ESP-NOW, GATT Proxy)
  * research routing & message delivery (flooding vs directed routing, duplicate suppression, TTL and message IDs, addressing schemes)
  * research coexistence & timing (throughput limitations, scheduling)
  * research communication model (peer to peer, sensor data sharing, tunnelling, electing a leader, ACK, message storing until it can be delivered)
  * research power consumption, range testing, node spacing, antenna orientation
  * research self-healing behavior(auto-reroute if a node dissapears or a message is dropped)
* Have two devices communicate with each other over bluetooth and wifi
* three-node mesh network to forward messages (2 being edge nodes and 1 being a core node)
* gateway translation (Alice connects via bluetooth and bob connects via wifi)
* expand past 3 devices (n-hop test, will need to measure latency, delivery ratio, max throughput)
* security handshake (each intermediary device will only know the final destination, but won't know the contents of the message being passed)
* Alice and Bob both connect via computer or smartphone, one using BLE and the other using wifi. They should be able to communicate between each other where the mesh network figures out a path between them. Alice and bob should be far enough apart that their devices can't communicate directly
* implement self-healing, message storing, and some auto-negotation between the nodes to determine which are edge and which are core nodes. Allowing them to switch their roles if needed
