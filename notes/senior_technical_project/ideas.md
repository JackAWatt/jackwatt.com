* KVM devices where different keys can be mapped to different outputs. Allowing for one keyboard to send output to multiple computers at once. 

e.g.: the keys [a,b,c] could be sent to both computers, [d,e,f] could be sent to computer 1, and [h,i,j] could be sent to computer 2. 

* display high-jack device. 

* a small usb female to usb male adapter that can be inserted into a monitor or tv to high-jack the video output. It would then be transmitted through bluetooth or wifi to a secondary device.

(e.g. it could be plugged into the TV in the lab, and when Rejean shows the test but tells us not put our phones away, it could capture the screen with the test on it)

* smart window system

There would be a humidity and moisture sensor inside and outside of the window, as well as temperature sensors. Based on temperature, moisture, and humidity, the window would either open or close. 

There could also be an IoT component where the windows could be opened and closed remotely.
