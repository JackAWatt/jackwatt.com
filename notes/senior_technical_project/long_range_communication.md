# long range communication devices

* Attach screen and keyboard to esp32 and implement the funcionality to type and delete text
* Attach screen to another esp32 with the LORA modules on both. Implement being able to write to the second screen from the first device
* create a menu that will allow sending a new message and checking for messages, then test by sending a message from one device to the other
* implement a blinking LED to show when there is an unread message, and also no blinking LED when there are no unread messages, and also a seperate blinking LED to show when the other device is close enough to communicate
* connect batteries so the devices are portable and implement an on/off switch.
* Implement the ability to send a message when the other device is out of range, and have the device send the message when the other device is in range.
* implement public/private key to encrypt and decrypt so the messages can't be sniffed in transit.
* design and print a PCB
* design and print a case for both devices
* (optional) implement being able to send voice messages
