# Long Range Secure Messaging Devices

These devices--I'll create two of them--will have a small physical keyboard, a screen, and bluetooth, wifi, or RF--I'm not sure which yet.  

There will also--possibly--be a third device used to try to sniff the communication between the devices--altough it would probably be most practical to do this using my laptop with an external connected device that is capable of packet injection. 

* Reserach which microcontrollers, keyboards, and network devices to use

* Have one device with a keyboard and screen power on and display text inputed from the keyboard
* Have the inputed text persist when the power is off
* Send the inputed text to a second device and have it appear on screen
* implement encryption to prevent the text from being visable if someone sniffs the connection
* Have the messages on the first device wait to be delivered if the other device isn't on or close enough
* add a way to power from a battery rather than the USB cable which we've used up until now
* move from a breadboard to a permenant solution(PCB?)
* Put it in a 3D printed case(which I'll have to learn how to design)
