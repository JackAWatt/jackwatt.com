In this project I struggled mostly with the ultiboard portion. Creating the provided circuit in multisim was straight forward, because I just had to recreate the provided schematic. In ultiboard, however, I had to route all of the traces on a double sided PCB. In the end, I had to use autoroute to get started--shown by my instructor, Saad. This spaced out my components and drew traces. The autorouted traces really helped me visualize what I needed to do, but the trace site was too small, so I had to manually change them all. I couldn't just draw back in larger traces because there wasn't enough room. 

Looking back, the struggles I had in this project really helped me excel in the test on PCB's. While I'll say that the PCB design I'm providing isn't great, or even good, I will say that struggling with this project really helped me learn how to design and route a PCB. In the state the project is in now, there are only 3 corner holes, because when I was almost done I realized that autoroute knocked one of my corners outside of the PCB. I think I would have to reroute at least half of the components if I were to put the corner back in. 

Ultimately, this is a bad design, and I wouldn't reccomend having it printed, but I did learn a lot, and given more time I believe I could fix all of the issues I created.
