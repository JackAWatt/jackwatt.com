In this project I struggled mostly with the ultiboard portion. Creating the provided circuit in multisim was straight forward, because I just had to recreate the provided schematic. In ultiboard, however, I had to route all the traces on a double-sided PCB. In the end, I had to use autoroute to get started--shown by my instructor, Saad. This spaced out my components and drew traces. The autorouted traces really helped me visualize what I needed to do, but the trace size was too small, so I had to manually change them all. I couldn't just draw back in larger traces because there wasn't enough room. 

Looking back, the struggles I had in this project really helped me excel in the PCB test. While I'll say that the PCB design I'm providing isn't great, or even good, I will say that struggling with this project really helped me learn how to design and route a PCB. In the state the project is in now, there are only 3 corner holes, because when I was almost done, I realized that autoroute knocked one of my corners outside of the PCB. I think I would have to reroute at least half of the components if I were to put the corner back in. 

I have a hard time visualizing where the routes for the components should go. The rat's nest really messed me up. I felt like it would be easier to turn off the rat's nest and look up the pin numbers, to be able to figure out the routes without relying on the rat's nest. However, after our end of term test, I believe starting this project again would be easier, as I'm now better able to visualize how to design a PCB in ultiboard.

After I missed the final check, I spent a few hours fixing most of what I needed to have done for that check. Now, all my traces are the right size, but I'm still missing one of the corner holes. 

Ultimately, this is a bad design, and I wouldn't recommend having it printed, but I did learn a lot and given more time I believe I could fix all of the issues I created.
