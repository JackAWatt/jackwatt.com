# Unit 4: AVR Architecture

---

### 1.
a) How many bits wide are the AVRâ€™s GPRs?  

* 8 bits

b) What is the largest value that can be moved into a GPR in Hex and Decimal?

* $0xFF_{16}$

* $255_{10}$

---

### 2.
What are the 2 types of memory space in the AVR?

* Program Memory

* Data memory

---

### 3.
List some advantages of SRAM over EEPROM:

* Faster read/write
* SRAM doesn't have the wear out issues that EEPROM does
* Direct Byte access


---

### 4.
List some advantages of EEPROM over SRAM:

* Non-volatile
* Data persists without power
* Low power for standby

---

### 5.
GPRs, I/O registers and SRAM comprise the:

* Data memory

---

### 6.
The standard I/O memory in AVRs is ____ bytes.

* 64

---

### 7.
At what I/O address is the Status Register?

* 0x3F

---

### 8.
What is an ALU?

* Arithmetic logic unit

---

### 9.
What type of Program ROM does the AVR use?

* EEPROM (flash memory)

---

### 10.
a) How many bits wide is Program Memory?  

* 16

b) How many bits wide is Data Memory?

* 8
* 
---

### 11.
What is the function of the Program Counter?

* to hold the address of the next instruction to be executed
---

### 12.
The ATmega256 has 256K Bytes of ROM. How many bits wide is its Program Counter?

* $\frac {x^n}{b} = x^{n-1}\ for\ x = b$

* $2^8 * 2^{10} = 2^{18}$

* $\frac {2^{18}}{2} = 2^{17}$

* the program counter has a bit width of 17

---
### 13.
How many bits wide is the data bus for Program and Data Memory?

* Data - 6

* Program - 16
