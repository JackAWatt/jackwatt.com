# Assignment #5

## Part A

### 1. Write instructions to move the value `0x34` into the `R29` register.

`LDI R16, 0x34`

`MOV R29, R16`

* note: It's not possible to move a value into a registy by value, so I used the `load immediate` instruction to load it into `R16` first 

### 3. Write instructions to add the values `0x16` and `0xCD`. Place the result in the `R19` register.  

`LDI R19, 0x16`

`LDI R20, 0xCD`

`ADD R19, R20`

### 4. **True or False:** No value can be moved directly into the GPRs.  

The question is ambigious and can't be answered without clarification. I'll answer why it could be either depending on the meaning of the question:

If by move, the question means with the `mov` command, then the answer is no. 

If by move, the question doesn't mean only with the `mov` command an

### 5. What is the largest hex value that can be moved into an 8-bit register?  
   * What is the decimal equivalent of that hex value?  



### 6. The vast majority of registers in the AVR are _____-bit.

## Part B

### 1. **True or False:** No value can be loaded directly into internal SRAM.  



### 2. Write instructions to load value `0x95` into the `SPL` I/O register.  



### 3. Write instructions to add `2` to the contents of `R18`.  



### 4. Write instructions to add the values `0x16` and `0xCD`. Place the result in location `0x400` of the data memory.  



### 5. What is the largest hex value that can be moved into a location in the data memory?  

   
   
   * What is the decimal equivalent of the hex value?
   


### 6. `"ADD R16, R3"` puts the result in _____.  
### 7. What does `"OUT OCR0, R23"` do?  
### 8. What is wrong with `"STS OCR0, R23"`? What does it do?
