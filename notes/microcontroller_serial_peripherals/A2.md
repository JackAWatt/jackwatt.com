# Assignment #5

## Part A

1. Write instructions to move the value `0x34` into the `R29` register.

`LDI R16, 0x34`
`MOV R29, R16`

3. Write instructions to add the values `0x16` and `0xCD`. Place the result in the `R19` register.  
4. **True or False:** No value can be moved directly into the GPRs.  
5. What is the largest hex value that can be moved into an 8-bit register?  
   What is the decimal equivalent of that hex value?

2. Write instructions to load value `0x95` into the `SPL` I/O register.  
3. Write instructions to add `2` to the contents of `R18`.  
4. Write instructions to add the values `0x16` and `0xCD`. Place the result in location `0x400` of the data memory.  
5. What is the largest hex value that can be moved into a location in the data memory?  
   What is the decimal equivalent of the hex value?  
6. `"ADD R16, R3"` puts the result in _____.  
7. What does `"OUT OCR0, R23"` do?  
8. What is wrong with `"STS OCR0, R23"`? What does it do?
