## Chapter 19 Assignment: Pressure Measurement

### 1. A very simple device used to measure pressure is the **__________**: a fluid-filled tube where an applied gas pressure causes the fluid height to shift proportionately.

* `Manometer`

A manometer is a simple pressure meassuring device, it consists of a U-shaped tube filled with a liquid. One end of the tube is open to atmosphere, and the other is connected to the gas whose pressure is to be meassured. When the gas applies pressure, it pushes the liquid in the tube causing a difference in the fluid height. 

The relationship is `P = pgh`

Where

* `P` = pressure difference
* `p` = density of the liquid
* `g` = acceleration due to gravity
* `h` = height difference between the two liquid columns--each side of the U-tube holds a column of fluid

### 2. As the test specimen is stretched or compressed by the application of force, the conductors of the **__________** are similarly deformed, changing its electrical resistance.

* `Strain Gauge`

A strain gauge is an electrical sensor that measures tensile and compressive strain. 

It's usually a thin, zig-zag pattern of wire or metal foil glued to a surface. When the surface deforms due to force or pressure:

* The metal foil inside the gauge also stretches or compresses
* Its length and cross-sectional area change
* Its electrical resistenance changes

The resistance-strain relationship is expressed by:

$$\frac {\Delta R}{R} = G * \epsilon$$

Where:

* $\frac {\Delta R}{R}$ = change in the resistance
* `G` = the gauge factor (property of the strain gauge)
* `ɛ` = change in length

### 3. A capacitance detector circuit uses **__________** signal to measure the difference in capacitance between the two halves, translating that into a DC signal which ultimately becomes the signal output by the instrument representing pressure.

* `AC excitation`

A capacitive pressure sensor works on the principle that the capacitance between two plates changes as one plate moves when pressure is applied. 

There are typically two fixed plate and one movable diaphragm in the middle. The diaphragm moves under pressure--closer to one plate and farther from the other. Any motion of the diaphragm changes the capacitance.

This is expressed by:

$$C = \frac {\epsilon A}{d}$$

Where: 

* `ɛ` = dielectric constant
* `A` = plate area
* `d` = distance between plates

The AC signal is sent through the two capacitors, when the diaphragm moves, their capactiances change unequally. The difference in AC response is converted into a DC output voltage representing the applied pressure.  



### 4. The most common sensing element used by modern DP transmitters is the diaphragm. One side of this diaphragm receives process fluid pressure from the **“(1)__________”** port, while the other receives process fluid pressure from the **“(2)__________”** port. Any difference of pressure between the two ports causes the diaphragm to **(3)__________** from its normal resting position. This is then translated into an output signal by any number of different technologies, depending on the manufacturer and model of the transmitter.

* (1) `high`
* (2) `low`
* (3) `deflect`

A Differential-pressure transpitter measures the difference between two process pressures. It does this by using a flexible diaphragm sealed between two chambers--one connected to the high-pressure line and one connected to the low-pressure line. When the two side experience different pressures, the diaphragm bends towards the lower-pressure side. This deflection is transfered to a sensor element(e.g. strain gauge, capactiance plate). The electronics inside the transpitter then convert that change into a standarized output (usually 4-20 mA or a digital signal)



### 5. What PV properties can a Differential Pressure Transmitter be used to measure?

* `differential pressure`
* `gauge pressure`
* `vacuum`
* `absolute pressure`
* `liquid level`
*  `flow rate`

### 6. What is the difference between Gage and Absolute pressure? Which can be negative?

* `Gauage pressure` is measured relative to atmospheric pressure and can be negative. 

$$P_{gauge} = P_{absolute} - P_{atmospheric}$$

* `Absolute pressure` is measured relative to a perfect vacuum and cannot be negative

$$P_{absolute} = P_{gauge} + P_{atmospheric}$$

Pressure is always measured relative to some reference point. 

### 7. What is the difference between piezoelectric and strain-gauge transducers?

* `Piezoelectric transducers` generate a voltage when pressure is applied. They are best for dynamic or raplidly changing pressures. The reason for this is that 

* `strain-gauge transducers` change their eletrical resistance when deformed by pressure

### 8. Convert 3 psia to kPa, mBars, mmHg, and mmH₂O:

### 9. In a ceramic cell which electrical property varies with pressure as it is compressed, and the diaphragm deforms?



### 10. In the Hydrostatic pressure transmitter example, which electrical property varies with pressure?



### 11. Hydrostatic pressure can be used to measure tank **__________**.
