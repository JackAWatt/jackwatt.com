## Chapter 6 Assignment  
*(Intro to Industrial Instrumentation)*

### Referring to Section 6.1 Example: Boiler Water Level

**1. What is the Process?**

Steam Boiler, to control the water level in the steam drum.

**2. What is the Process Variable?**

The water Level in the steam drum.

**3. What is the Manipulated Variable?**

The feedwater flow Rate in the boiler

**4. What is the Final Control Element?**

The air operated feedwater control valve that opens and closes to change the amount of water entering the boiler.

**5. What is the Primary Sensing Element?**

The level trasmitter (LT).

**6. What is the “Realistic” Zero and Span?**

Zero: 3 PSI ; 40% steam drum water level

Span: 12 PSI ; 20% steam drum water level

**7. What is “A.S.”?**

Air Supply

### Typical signals to and from Controllers are:  

`psi to psi`

* 3 to 15 PSI

* 3 to 27 PSI

* 6 to 30 PSI

`mA to mA`

* 4 to 20 mA

**8. Why are the above signal ranges not designed to reach 0 psi or 0 mA?**

0 PSI and 0 mA implies instrument failure. The ranges mentioned above are the live ranges, where 3 PSI / 4 mA means the process is at its minimum measurable value

### Referring to page 525

**9. Explain the difference between the instruments labelled:**  
LT, LSH, LSL, LAH, LAL

* LT - Level Transmitter

Measure the liquid level

* LSH - Level Switch High

Activates when the level becomes too high

* LSL - Level Switch Low

Activates when the level becomes too low

* LAH - Level Alarm High

Gives a warning or alarm for high level

* LAL - Level Alarm Low

Gives a warning or alarm for low level
