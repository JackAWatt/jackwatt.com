**Temperature is the measure of** ________ **molecular kinetic energy within a substance, while Thermal Energy is a measure of the** ________ **kinetic energy. Heat is a measure of the** ________ **of Thermal Energy.**

**If we bond these two strips of metal together, this differential growth will result in a bending motion greatly exceeding the linear expansion. This device is called a** ________.

**The major difference between thermistors and RTDs is linearity: thermistors are highly** ________ **but** ________, **whereas RTDs are relatively** ________ **but very** ________.  

**RTDs are made of pure** ________.

**Instead of using an Ohm-meter to measure RTD resistance, a 4-Wire RTD circuit uses: a** ________ **and a** ________.

**What is the advantage of using a 4-Wire RTD circuit (over a 2-wire one) to measure temperature?**

---

**Though typically not as** ________ **as RTDs, thermocouples are more rugged, have greater temperature measurement spans, and are easier to manufacture in different physical forms.**

**When two dissimilar metal wires are joined together at one end, a** ________ **is produced at the other end that is approximately proportional to temperature.**

**What 2 metals are used to make a Type J thermocouple?**

**Why is “reference junction” compensation required in thermocouple circuits?**

### Which of thermistor, thermocouple, or RTD:

- **Can have a negative temperature coefficient?**  
- **Is non-linear?**  
- **Is useful only at low temperatures?**  
- **Is useful at very high temperatures?**  
- **Is the most accurate and stable for most industrial applications?**  
- **Is the least costly?**  
- **Generates its own electric potential (does not require power)?**

### Referring to the following diagram:

**Circle the Sensing Junction**

**Put a square around the reference junction**

**Put a triangle around the location of the temp-compensation thermistor**

**What metals are in the “Extension wire”?**

**A major disadvantage of non-contact thermometry is that it only reveals the** ________ **temperature of an object.**

**When measuring temperature with non-contact pyrometers (infrared thermocouples), why does the distance separating the sensor from the target surface not affect the reading even though IR intensity decreases by the inverse-square law?**

**A very useful application of non-contact sensor technology is** ________, **where a dense array of infrared sensors provides a graphic display of objects, hot shown as red tones and cold shown as** ________ **tones.**

**A** ________ **is a thermally conductive protrusion into a process vessel or pipe allowing a temperature-sensitive instrument to detect temperature without opening a hole in the vessel or pipe.**
