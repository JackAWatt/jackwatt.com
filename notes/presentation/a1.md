# How to learn

* cognitive load

* desirable difficulty - zone of proximal development

* scaffolding

* spaced review/repetition

* fractional implicit repetition (compounding)

* interleaving

* pulling information from memory vs note taking and looking back


* the retention gain from reproducing information by repeatedly pulling it from one's brain, utterly dominates the retention gain of repeatedly consuming it.
