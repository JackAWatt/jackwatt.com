# How to learn

There are many misconceptions in education on how to learn effecicteively and efficently. First I'm going to talk about how to learn, then I'm going to talk about why learning can feel hard or even impossible, and then I'm going to end with some modes of learning. 


### 1

* spaced review

* interleaving

* pulling information from memory vs note taking and looking back

* fractional implicit repetition

* the retention gain from reproducing information by repeatedly pulling it from one's brain, utterly dominates the retention gain of repeatedly consuming it. 

### 2


* cognitive load

* scaffolding


### 3

* passive practice vs deliberate

* mastery based vs semester based

### 4

* learning styles (a misconception is that students need many different explanations of the same topic until one clicks, when really what they need is a single battle tested example)
