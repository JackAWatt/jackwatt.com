# Retrospective (WIP)

My goals for 2026 are based on my failings from 2019 up utnil 2025. I've created a list of resources and objectives every year since 2019. I started doing this because of Alex Korbonits' [A year back, a year ahead.](https://korbonits.com/2019/01/01/New-Years-Resolutions-2019.html). He listed goals for the year to come and a retrospective on the previous year. Up until now I've mostly posted goals for the coming year. A few years I just listed books without any context, other years I came up with plans and objectives. This year I'm going to create the retrospective for the previous year, to really think through what has worked and what hasn't. I've also listed far fewer books than most years. Most years the list of books are more like creating options for myself and doing a bit of research before the year begins, this year I want to get through a higher amount than in previous years. 

In 2025 I got through precicely one book, Justin Skycak's [Advice on Upskilling](https://www.justinmath.com/books/), and started his The Math Academy Way. I also started The Foundations of Mathematics, How to Solve It, and How Not to Be wrong. All of these books I started are on my TBR this year.

# Courses

Starting in January I'm starting a 2 course series in college on calculus. Alongside that I will be taking precalculus with Math Academy, and then possibly resuming with Math Foundations II--which is where I stopped last time I used math Academy.

# changes I want to make in 2026

More of my time needs to be spent on deliberate practice. Too much time goes to passively consuming videos and podcasts. Even the way I've practiced programming and maths has to change. I had an idea about this stuff since I first read Azeria's blog posts on [deep work](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/), [the process of masetring a skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-process-of-mastering-a-skill/), and [paradox of choice](https://azeria-labs.com/paradox-of-choice/), but it didn't fully hit me until I encountered [Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/)'s writing. I've learned that the way I practice isn't optimal, and it mostly is calibrated for enjoyment. I did a lot of code kata's, which revolve around arbitrily restrictions to common programming problems. These code katas are fun, but I think I've mostly found *clever* ways to solve problems that would have been trivial if I had my math and computer science foundations shored up. 

I've kind of deluded myself into believing I wasn't missing that much of my fundementals, because it's common to hear "Most of programming doesn't require advanced maths", and maybe that's true, but at the point I'm at now, I very much want to learn the advanced math and then will be in a position to decide if I want to work on problems that don't leverage maths or not. 

I've jumped from topic to topic for a long time. I started with IT, doing stuff such as learning how operating systems work, configuring networks, building systems, troubleshooting problems. Then, I moved into computer programming, where I took a business course on computer programming. In the entire course we took 1 term of data structures, and 1 term of computer math. Then, I moved into information security, where I think I did a decent job of grasping the fundementals. On TryHackMe's platform I have five of their certificates(web fundemtnals, complete beginner, Jr Pentetration Tester, Pre Security, and CompTIA Pentest+) for completing learning paths. 

After completing a lot of challenges and walk throughs on TryHackMe, I ended up enrolling in a 2 year Electronics Engineer Technology course. I'm just about to start my second last term, and will be commpletely finished in April. I do enjoy electronics, and I do foresee getting a job in this area, but I also want to self study maths and computer science at the same time. Through school I've gained a solid foundation in how electronics work, how to build electronics, and how to troubleshoot. The next level for me, I believe, is going to require some math. Probability and Statistics will open up areas such as Analog and Digital signal processing and communication. Calculus will open up new ways to solve circuits. More math in general will open up being able to take a more advanced electricity and magnetism course than the one I took in my college program.
