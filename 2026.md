# Retrospective (WIP)

My goals for 2026 are based on my failings from 2019 up utnil 2025. I've created a list of resources and objectives every year since 2019. I started doing this because of Alex Korbonits' [A year back, a year ahead.](https://korbonits.com/2019/01/01/New-Years-Resolutions-2019.html). He listed goals for the year to come and a retrospective on the previous year. Up until now I've mostly posted goals for the coming year. A few years I just listed books without any context, other years I came up with plans and objectives. This year I'm going to create the retrospective for the previous year, to really think through what has worked and what hasn't. I've also listed far fewer books than most years. Most years the list of books are more like creating options for myself and doing a bit of research before the year begins, this year I want to get through a higher amount than in previous years. 

In 2025 I got through precicely one book, Justin Skycak's [Advice on Upskilling](https://www.justinmath.com/books/), and started his The Math Academy Way. I also started The Foundations of Mathematics, How to Solve It, and How Not to Be wrong. All of these books I started are on my TBR this year.

# Courses

Starting in January I'm starting a 2 course series in college on calculus. Alongside that I will be taking precalculus with Math Academy, and then possibly resuming with Math Foundations II--which is where I stopped last time I used math Academy.
