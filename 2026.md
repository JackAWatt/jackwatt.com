# Retrospective

My goals for 2026 are based on my failings from 2019 up until 2025. I've created a list of resources and objectives every year since 2019. I started doing this because of Alex Korbonits' [A year back, a year ahead.](https://korbonits.com/2019/01/01/New-Years-Resolutions-2019.html). He listed goals for the year to come and a retrospective on the previous year. Up until now I've mostly posted goals for the coming year. A few years I just listed books without any context, other years I came up with plans and objectives. This year I'm going to create the retrospective for the previous year, to really think through what has worked and what hasn't. I've also listed far fewer books than most years. Most years the list of books are more like creating options for myself and doing a bit of research before the year begins, this year I want to get through a higher amount than in previous years. 

In 2025 I got through precicely one book, Justin Skycak's [Advice on Upskilling](https://www.justinmath.com/books/), and started his The Math Academy Way. I also started The Foundations of Mathematics, How to Solve It, and How Not to Be wrong. All of these books I started are on my TBR this year. 

# changes I want to make in 2026

This is mostly thinking on paper, rather than something that's been properly thought out and edited. 

More of my time needs to be spent on deliberate practice. Too much time goes to passively consuming videos and podcasts. Even the way I've practiced programming and maths has to change. I've had an idea about this stuff since I first read Azeria's blog posts on [deep work](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/), [the process of masetring a skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-process-of-mastering-a-skill/), and [paradox of choice](https://azeria-labs.com/paradox-of-choice/), but it didn't fully hit me until I encountered [Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/)'s writing. I've learned that the way I practice isn't optimal, and it mostly is calibrated for enjoyment. I did a lot of code kata's, which revolve around arbitrily restrictions to common programming problems. These code katas are fun, but I think I've mostly found *clever* ways to solve problems that would have been trivial if I had my math and computer science foundations shored up. 

I've kind of deluded myself into believing I wasn't missing that much of my fundementals, because it's common to hear "Most of programming doesn't require advanced maths", and maybe that's true, but at the point I'm at now, I very much want to learn the advanced math--that I'm missing--and then will be in a position to decide if I want to work on problems that don't leverage maths or not. 

I've jumped from topic to topic for a long time. I started with IT, doing stuff such as learning how operating systems work, configuring networks, building systems, troubleshooting problems. Then, I moved into computer programming, where I took a business course on computer programming. In the entire course we took 1 term of data structures, and 1 term of computer math. Then, I moved into information security, where I think I did a decent job of grasping the fundementals. On TryHackMe's platform I have five of their certificates(web fundementals, complete beginner, Jr Pentetration Tester, Pre Security, and CompTIA Pentest+) for completing learning paths. 

After completing a lot of challenges and walk throughs on TryHackMe, I ended up enrolling in a 2 year Electronics Engineer Technology course. I'm just about to start my second last term, and will be commpletely finished in April. I do enjoy electronics, and I do foresee getting a job in this area, but I also want to self study maths and computer science at the same time. Through school I've gained a solid foundation in how electronics work, how to build electronics, and how to troubleshoot. The next level for me, I believe, is going to require some math. Probability and Statistics will open up areas such as Analog and Digital signal processing and communication. Calculus will open up new ways to solve circuits. More math in general will open up being able to take a more advanced electricity and magnetism course than the one I took in my college program. 

Justin Skycak(math academy) talks about the pitfalls of discovery learning, which I've come to understand I've fallen for over and over again. In 2026 my main anti-goal is to stop discovery learning. I used to grind competitive programming problems a lot, but I was mostly coming up with hacky solutions to these problems, because I didn't have my fundementals down. 

I also know that I need to cut down on videos and podcast, or at least I need to become much more selectrive on what I want to listen to and watch. In 2023, a lot of the [books I wanted](http://jackwatt.com/2023#books-rated-5-stars-by-random-person-on-goodreads) to read were found on [Alex Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11509598-alex-lee)'s goodread profile. From what he was reading and his reviews, it was clear that he is further in his jouney with philosophy, maths, and computer science than I am. This past year, the person I've most been watching is [Didier 'Dirac's ghost' Gaulin](https://x.com/DiracGhost). He has a lot of reccomendations for books and videos, and I'm going to allow myself to watch the videos he suggests, as I think they will help in my journey to upskill in mathematics, philosphy, and computer science. I'm also invested in NJ Wildberger's videos, and to a lesser extent, [Chycho's](https://www.youtube.com/@chycho). I say to a lesser extent becuase it's been quite awhile since Chycho posted math content, but the content he did post was insightful, conceptual, and foundational. 

I'm more okay with watching videos on philosophy this year than I am maths or computer science, and the reason for that is that I can see a clear path to getting better at maths and computer science that strictly involves solving problems with math academy and possibly leetcode, codeforces, etc. With philosphy, I sometimes find when I read, I'm lost because I don't have my foundations down. I think I'm at the point where a video that goes over a book or essay is worth engaging with because--I think--it's helping build up my fundementals, which should help me get to the point--where I am with maths and cs--where the best use of my time isn't passive videos, but direct engagement with the source material. 


# Goals

### Huberman Diet

Huberman talks about eating only [fish, meat, eggs, vegetables, fruit]. Which means no [bread, pasta, rice, milk]. I'm not going to follow this exactly, I do plan on eating some bread, and a little bit of whole fat plain yogurt. The way I plan to eat will cut out 99% of the things Huberman talksa bout going without. Just out of convience I will be keeping some things, but a lot of how I eat currently isn't going to be an option going forward. 

### Upskill on math and computer science

The main focus outside of school for the first four months of the year is Calculus using math academy. The plan overall is to grind Calculus I -> Calculus II -> Methods of Proof -> Linear Algebra -> Multivariale Calculus -> Discrete Mathematics. I don't know if that's the right order or not, but I do want to grind a lot of math before I try to look at computer science again. Even though I'm currently finishing up a 2 year program in electronics engineering technology, I believe the thing that aligns most with my overall goals is to finally shore up my missing math skills.

# Courses

Starting in January I'm starting a 2 course series in college on calculus. Alongside that I will be taking precalculus with Math Academy, and then possibly resuming with Math Foundations II--which is where I stopped last time I used math Academy.
