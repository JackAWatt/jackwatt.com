Tomorrow I start Year 2 of Electronics Engineering Technology. There is a lot I have to reflect on from last year and my 4 month break. I did very well in school last year grades wise, but I feel like I could have learned a lot more in the same time had I been a bit more systematic. Justin Skycak has affirmed by belief that note taking is mostly a waste of time. Every term I start out by taking good notes, but then quickly stop. 

I want to do more writing, which will include turning notes of some kind into something in the style of a blog post or book. Something I'll be able to look back at to refamiliarize myself with in the futre. 

Notes shouldn't be looked back at as a way to learn or understand the content. Justin--the research--says that recalling the information and pulling it out of memory is how learning really happens. 

This year I'm going to try to invest more in quizzlet, which I didn't use much last year.
