<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day #3 <a href="https://twitter.com/_MathAcademy_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@_MathAcademy_</a> <br><br>5.75 hours today. I'm still mostly refreshing what I learned on MA in 2024. At this pace though I'm going to be onto new content soon. I've said that I'm going to commit for 2 months, but I'm hoping that I'll end up sticking with it until I go back to school in September. <br><br>MA is superior to the experience I've had in math classes in college and learning on my own. Before MA everything felt either too easy or impossible. Now I know with MA if something feels easy that I'm going to master it quickly and then will be served content that I'll actually struggle with. <br><br>I really like that the system is making all of the decisions for me on what to learn and when, so I can just focus on practising and solving problems. There are going to be some tough walls to get over soon, and I'm excited for that. <br><br>@HabitGraph <a href="https://t.co/zIVHM0Z171">pic.twitter.com/zIVHM0Z171</a></p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916669683832422723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
