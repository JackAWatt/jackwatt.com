# Math Academy

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day #2 <a href="https://twitter.com/_MathAcademy_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@_MathAcademy_</a> <br><br>3.25 hours today. I struggled a bit with geometry word problems. After I got a few of them wrong it gave me easier problems which I did fine with. <br><br>Everything else has mostly been a refresher on things I learned previously.<a href="https://twitter.com/HabitGraph?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HabitGraph</a> <a href="https://t.co/rGDRq7FHeA">pic.twitter.com/rGDRq7FHeA</a></p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916307341818896734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My geometry skills are lacking, for sure. A college course I took this year involved trig identities, but this is really my first time figuring out angles based on multiple regular polygons. <br><br>One question required seeing that the missing angle would form a 360, which I missed.</p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916307343849230355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Finding midpoints, slope, y intercept, etc were all quite straight forward.

# X post on InfoSec and Electronics

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m not really doing anything InfoSec related anymore. <br><br>Most of my focus for the past year has been on Electronics and a bit of math. In the future I&#39;d like to focus on security using my new electronics knowledge, but for now I need to focus on the fundamentals.</p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916329583537700977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I felt like I was making a lot of progress, but it wasn&#39;t focused enough. It was really just doing a lot of rooms on TryHackMe. I learned a lot, but I didn&#39;t see a path towards working in InfoSec.</p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916329585056030740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The school I attend has a 2 year Cyber Security program that I wanted to take, but it&#39;s a post-grad program. <br><br>I decided to take Electronics because I saw it as an alternate path into security. Possibly something like embedded security.</p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916329586478006549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve jumped around so much though in the past 15 years. Having exposure to a lot of different things is cool, but I needed to pick something and stick with it for a few years<br><br>for now that is electronics. Hopefully in the future it will be a mix of electronics and security.</p>&mdash; _ (@WattSec_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WattSec_/status/1916329587811794981?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 27, 2025</a></blockquote>
